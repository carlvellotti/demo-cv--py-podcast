Design review approved the tabbed settings UI. Key decisions:
- Tabbed > accordion (better for mobile)
- Quiet hours moved to main settings (was buried)
- Using system fonts instead of custom (faster load)

Lisa updating Figma by EOD Wednesday.

ML model v1.2 showing 23% improvement in click prediction accuracy. Sarah deploying to staging next week.

Concern: Model accuracy dropped during holiday period (Dec 20 - Jan 5). Need to handle seasonality better.
