# Design Review - Notification Settings UI

**Date:** Jan 27, 2026
**Attendees:** Carl, Lisa (Design), James (Frontend)

## Reviewed
- Settings page mockups v3
- Mobile responsive designs
- Accessibility audit results

## Decisions
1. Go with tabbed layout over accordion (better for mobile)
2. Add "quiet hours" toggle to main settings (was buried in advanced)
3. Use system font stack instead of custom fonts (faster load)

## Feedback
- Lisa: Need higher contrast on muted notification indicators
- James: Can we lazy-load the preference history section?
- Carl: Add tooltip explaining ML learning period

## Next Steps
- Lisa to update Figma with changes by EOD Wednesday
- James to start component scaffolding
- Carl to write microcopy for tooltips
