**Attendees:** Carl, Sarah, Mike, Lisa

## What went well

- Good collaboration between frontend and backend teams
- Zero P0 bugs in production

## What didn't go well
- ML model accuracy dropped during holiday data
- Unclear requirements on digest email timing
- Too many meetings mid-sprint

## Action Items
- [ ] @Carl - Clarify digest timing requirements with stakeholders
- [ ] @Sarah - Schedule model retraining with fresh data
- [ ] @Mike - Propose "no meeting Wednesday" policy

## Notes
Team velocity was 34 points, up from 28 last sprint. Capacity for next sprint is reduced due to Mike PTO.
